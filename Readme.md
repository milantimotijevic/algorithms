ALGORITHMS CHEAT SHEET

Selection Sort - repeatedly find the minimum element as you progress down the array. Nested for loop.

Bubble Sort - compare two adjacent elements and swap them accordingly. Do-while until no swaps have occurred, plus nested for loop.

Insertion Sort - compare the current element to its predecessor. If it is less than it, compare it to the predecessor's predecessor. When you get to the front of the array, or an element that is less or equal to the current element, move the current element to just after it and push forward the ones between.
